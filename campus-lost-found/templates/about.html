            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to create a seamless, efficient platform that helps campus community members quickly recover their lost items. By leveraging advanced data structures like HashMaps, Tries, and Binary Search Trees, we've built a smart matching system that connects lost items with their rightful owners.</p>
            
            <p>We believe that technology should make life easier, and losing something valuable shouldn't be a source of ongoing stress. Our platform aims to turn the frustration of losing an item into the joy of finding it again.</p>
            
            <p>Through intelligent matching algorithms and an intuitive user interface, we're committed to making the campus a more connected and helpful community where everyone looks out for each other.</p>

            <h3>What Makes Us Unique</h3>
            <p><strong>Smart Matching Algorithm:</strong> Our similarity scoring system analyzes multiple factors including item name, description, category, location, and date to provide the most relevant matches.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fast Search:</strong> Using Trie data structures, we provide instant autocomplete suggestions as you type, making it faster to report and search for items.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Organized Data:</strong> Binary Search Trees help us efficiently organize items by category and date, ensuring quick retrieval and filtering.</p>
            
            <p><strong>User-Friendly Design:</strong> Our modern, gradient-themed interface is both beautiful and functional, designed with Figma and implemented using the latest web technologies.</p>
